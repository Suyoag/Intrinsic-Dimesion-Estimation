ToDo

Put links to the relevant papers here.

http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2290-intrinsic-dimension-estimation-using-packing-numbers.pdf
Describe the algorithms you'll implement here.

Algorithim found in above paper page 6 figure 2


Link and description of the datasets you'll test here.

Implementation details: describe the implementation details here (language, libraries, OS). If there are nonstandard libraries, then use Docker too.

List papers that give you comparable results and that you'll compare your results to.
