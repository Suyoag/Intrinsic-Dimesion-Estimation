# Intrinsic-Dimesion-Estimation

ToDo

Put links to the relevant papers here.

Describe the algorithms you'll implement here.

Link and description of the datasets you'll test here.

Implementation details: describe the implementation details here (language, libraries, OS). If there are nonstandard libraries, then use Docker too.

List papers that give you comparable results and that you'll compare your results to.

Is this todo for all of us? Or just me
